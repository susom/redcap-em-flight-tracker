<h3>Manual Curation: Grant Wrangler</h3>

<p>Grant information is downloaded from several sites:</p>
<ul>
    <li>The <strong>NIH RePORTER</strong> is a data source provided by the NIH for health-related grants.</li>
    <li>The <strong>NSF Grants API</strong> provides access to other government grants except for Education grants.</li>
    <li>The <strong>IES Grants System</strong> can download grants from the U.S. Department of Education.</li>
    <li><strong>Internal Databases</strong> are often kept by institutions with a ledger of grant information. These are especially helpful for financial and budgetary analyses. Unfortunately, there is no one central format used by academic institutions. Therefore, connectivity would have to be formulated as described in Adding New Data Sources.</li>
</ul>

<p>After being downloaded, grants are processed and ordered by the overnight summary script. The overnight script combines the grants which have the same base number. (E.g., 5R01CA654321-02 and 5R01CA654321-03 are combined because they have the same base number R01CA654321. 5R01CA777777-04 and 1R01CA123456-01 are not combined because they have different base numbers, R01CA777777 and R01CA123456.) Once combined, the most recent fifteen grants are placed, in order of time, into slots on the <b>Summary</b> form. The algorithm for sorting these out is available in the Codebook (available in the Help menu).</p>

<p>In our experience, the grant information from the NIH RePORTER has an error ratio of less than one error per every one hundred grants (&lt; 1% of the grants). However, these errors do need to be corrected, hence the grant wrangler interface. To make periodic “grant wrangling” easier for large groups of scholars, we have created a webpage that allows the user to view new grants, if any, for each record for a user-determined number of days. You can view new grants by clicking the "New Grants Only" link while the default view consists of all grants over all time. This allows for review of all new grants in the period without also needing to view all old grants, greatly shortening the time it takes to review the entire population. The program manager is thus able to catch and correct errors such as a grant placed into the wrong bin, grant assigned to the wrong person (i.e., a grant where the scholar is a co-investigator, not the principal investigator), or missing grants. We recommend combing through the new grants about once per month to keep summary data accurate.</p>
